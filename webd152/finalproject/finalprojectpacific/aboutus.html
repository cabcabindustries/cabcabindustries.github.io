            <h3>Meet Franky!</h3>
            <p>
              Did you hear that? Was it a plane? Was it a bird? No it was Franky, our awesome bird watching expert who is able to imitate over 20 types of birds! Since a young child, he was always fascinated by wildlife. Spending most of his childhood hiking in the forests and mountains, he liked to imitate all the different birds he could hear. From a red-tailed hawk to a goldfinch, you wont be able to tell who is talking to who.
